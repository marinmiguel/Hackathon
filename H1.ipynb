    "# Hackathon: From Raw Data to ML-Ready Dataset\n",
    "## Insight-Driven EDA and End-to-End Feature Engineering on Airbnb Data Using pandas and Plotly\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a Hackathon?\n",
    "\n",
    "A hackathon is a fast-paced, collaborative event where participants use data and technology to solve a real problem end-to-end.  \n",
    "In this hackathon, you will work with a **real-world Airbnb dataset** and complete two interconnected goals:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Produce a **high-quality exploratory data analysis (EDA)** using `pandas` and `plotly`, extracting meaningful insights, trends, and signals from the data.  \n",
    "- Design and deliver a **clean, feature-rich, ML-ready dataset** that will serve as the foundation for a follow-up hackathon focused on building and evaluating machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to **get the most out of the data**: uncover structure and patterns through EDA, and engineer informative features (numerical, categorical, temporal, textual (TF–IDF), and optionally image-based) to maximize the predictive power of the final dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-success\">\n",
    "<b>About the Dataset</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Context</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "The data comes from <a href=\"https://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/\">Inside Airbnb</a>, an open project that publishes detailed, regularly updated datasets for cities around the world.  \n",
    "Each city provides three main CSV files:\n",
    "\n",
    "- <b>listings.csv</b> — property characteristics, host profiles, descriptions, amenities, etc.  \n",
    "- <b>calendar.csv</b> — daily availability and pricing information for each listing.  \n",
    "- <b>reviews.csv</b> — guest feedback and textual reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "These datasets offer a rich view of the short-term rental market, including availability patterns, pricing behavior, host attributes, and guest sentiment.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Inspiration</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "Your ultimate objective is to create a dataset suitable for training a machine learning model that predicts whether a specific Airbnb listing will be <b>available on a given date</b>, using property attributes, review information, and host characteristics.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-info\">\n",
    "<b>Task</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Using one city of your choice from Inside Airbnb, create an end-to-end pipeline that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Loads and explores the raw data (EDA).  \n",
    "2. Engineers features (numerical, categorical, temporal, textual TF–IDF, etc.).  \n",
    "3. Builds a unified ML-ready dataset.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Please remember to add comments explaining your decisions. Comments help us understand your thought process and ensure accurate evaluation of your work. This assignment requires code-based solutions—**manually calculated or hard-coded results will not be accepted**. Thoughtful comments and visualizations are encouraged and will be highly valued.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Write your solution directly in this notebook, modifying it as needed.\n",
    "- Once completed, submit the notebook in **.ipynb** format via Moodle.\n",
    "    \n",
    "<b>Collaboration Requirement: Git & GitHub</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "You must collaborate with your team using a **shared GitHub repository**.  \n",
    "Your use of Git is part of the evaluation. We will specifically look at:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Commit quality (clear messages, meaningful steps).  \n",
    "- Balanced participation across team members.  \n",
    "- Use of branches.  \n",
    "- Ability to resolve merge conflicts appropriately.  \n",

    "\n",
    "- Text columns often carry substantial predictive power, use text-vectorization methods to extract meaningful features.  \n",
    "- Make sure all columns use appropriate data types (categorical, numeric, datetime, boolean). Correct dtypes help prevent subtle bugs and improve performance.  \n",
    "- Feel free to enrich the dataset with any additional information you consider useful: engineered features, external data, derived temporal features, etc.  \n",
    "- If the dataset is too large for your computer, use <code>.sample()</code> to work with a subset while preserving the logic of your pipeline.  \n",
    "- Plotly offers a wide variety of powerful visualizations, experiment creatively, but always begin with a clear analytical question: *What insight am I trying to uncover with this plot?*\n",

    "#### **Boolean Conversion ('t'/'f' → 1/0)**\n",
    "Many Airbnb datasets store boolean values as strings ('t' for true, 'f' for false). Machine learning algorithms require numerical inputs, so we must convert these to binary integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Impact on modeling:**\n",
    "- Enables use in regression models\n",
    "- Allows correlation analysis\n",
    "- Reduces memory footprint (int8 vs. string)\n",
    "- Prevents encoding errors in scikit-learn pipelines\n",
    "\n",
    "**Columns affected:**\n",
    "- `host_is_superhost` — whether host has \"Superhost\" status (quality indicator)\n",
    "- `host_identity_verified` — whether host identity is verified (trust signal)\n",
    "- `instant_bookable` — whether guests can book without approval (convenience factor)\n",
    "- `has_availability` — whether listing has future availability\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Category Optimization**\n",
    "For variables like `room_type` with limited unique values, we convert to pandas `category` dtype:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "df['room_type'] = df['room_type'].astype('category')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits:**\n",
    "- **Memory efficiency** — categories stored as integers internally\n",
    "- **Faster operations** — optimized groupby and filtering\n",
    "- **Preserves semantic meaning** — maintains categorical nature\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Handling Missing Categorical Values**\n",

    "#### **Why This Is Necessary**\n",
    "Raw Airbnb data stores prices as strings with currency formatting:\n",
    "- Example: `\"$1,250.00\"` instead of `1250.0`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problems this causes:**\n",
    "- Cannot perform mathematical operations\n",
    "- Cannot compute statistics (mean, median)\n",
    "- Cannot use in regression models\n",
    "- Sorting produces incorrect results\n",
    "\n",
    "**After cleaning:**\n",
    "- Prices are float values ready for analysis\n",
    "- Can compute correlations with other features\n",
    "- Can train price prediction models\n",

    "```python\n",
    "df = df[df['price'] > 0]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why we remove zero/negative prices:**\n",
    "- **Data quality issue** — likely data entry errors\n",
    "- **Model corruption** — skews distribution statistics\n",
    "- **Prediction reliability** — unrealistic training examples\n",

    "**Conversion benefits:**\n",
    "- **Mathematical operations** — can compute averages, correlations\n",
    "- **Model compatibility** — scikit-learn requires numeric types\n",
    "- **Standardization** — consistent scale (0-1) for all percentages\n",
    "- **Interpretability** — easier to understand in decimal form\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "**Median vs. Mean:**\n",
    "- **Median** is robust to outliers\n",
    "- **Mean** is distorted by extreme values (e.g., 50-bedroom mansions)\n",
    "- Airbnb data often has long-tailed distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "- bedrooms: [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 50] → median=1.5, mean=9.5\n",
    "- Median provides more realistic imputation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Columns requiring imputation:**\n",
    "- **bedrooms** — some listings don't specify (studios, unique spaces)\n",
    "- **beds** — may differ from bedrooms (sofa beds, multiple beds per room)\n",
    "- **bathrooms** — sometimes not explicitly listed\n",
    "- **accommodates** — critical for capacity-based pricing\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why we can't drop missing values:**\n",
    "- Would lose significant data volume\n",

    "1. **Missing reviews** — new listings have no scores yet\n",
